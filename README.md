# How I Understand It: ML

Starting end-June 2023, I have stopped working, owing to not-so-great health.

After nearly two months of resting and recouping, I am beginning to feel like myself again. My body and brain feel rested, but my mind is beginning to feel restless, because I haven't done any "work".

So (*stretching and cracking fingers*), this is an attempt to slowly get back to work, by reprodcing, understanding different problems, concepts, projects in ML/DS.

Let's go.
